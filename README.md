# PlagaUnityGame
College Thesis in which I had 3 months to build a project. I chose to make a game. I did all animations and coding. 
Art was open source, and i would alter it frame by frame for animations. 
Its insane actually how hard I worked on this to get it to work in that short amounnt of time without prior experience. Coding physics was very fun.
